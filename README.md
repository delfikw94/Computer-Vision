# Pneumonia Detection on X-Ray Images
Image classification on X-Ray images for patient treatment efficiency

**Tools used** : Python, Google Colab (GPU runtime), Tensorflow, MobileNetV2 (pre-trained model), Streamlit, Heroku

**Category** : Deep learning, Computer Vision, Classification

**Year** : October 2021

**Features** : 2 class of x-ray images (normal lung and pneumonia)

**Model Algorithm** : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Transfer Learning using pre-trained model, Fine-tuning the pre-trained model

**Result** : The 3rd model (fine-tuning the pre-trained model) achieved the highest accuracy (98%) and the lowest loss-score (5.1%) in classifying the images
